# Hi! I'm Fernando Rios 👋

## About Me 🧠📊

I’m a **Data Scientist** with a background in **Data Science & AI, Marketing, and Quality Assurance**, focused on building practical, data-driven solutions. I mainly work with **Python, SQL, Pandas, and machine learning models**, and I’m especially interested in projects that connect data analysis with real-world impact.

I have experience leading **end-to-end data projects**, including computer vision models, cloud-based APIs, and user-facing applications built with **Streamlit**. I also bring a strong foundation in **web development** using **React and Next.js**, which allows me to approach problems from both a data and product perspective.

I value clean code, clear documentation, and projects that are functional, reproducible, and easy to understand.

✨ *Fun fact:* I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, usable tools.

## Featured Project 🌱☕

### Disease Detection in Coffee Plants

Computer vision project selected as **one of two winning proposals** during the Le Wagon Data Science & AI bootcamp.

- 🧭 **Project Lead** for a four-person team, coordinating development, timelines, and delivery.
- 🧠 Built a **VGG16-based model** to classify healthy coffee leaves and detect plant diseases from images.
- 📦 Packaged the model into a **modular Python package**.
- ☁️ Deployed the model via a **Dockerized API on Google Cloud** for cloud-based inference.
- 🖥️ Developed a **Streamlit interface** for real-time image classification.
- 📚 Delivered a fully functional, documented, and version-controlled application on GitHub.

✨ *Fun fact:* This project combines two of my favorite things — **machine learning and specialty coffee**.
